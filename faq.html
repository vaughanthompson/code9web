                        <h4>I'm considering switching from using the older copper phone service to fibre or VDSL cable internet. Will my existing alarm monitoring service still work? <span class="small">- Bruce M, Hamilton.</span></h4>
                        <div class="speechbubble">
                            <p>Code9 has a variety of communication options for existing systems and installers who can- in most cases, add more modern network connectivity to your existing system enabling communication over the internet or even cellular networks.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>We recently moved into an older home with with a newish, but un-monitored alarm system. The previous owners had Ultra Fast Broadband installed, removing the old phone line in the process. Can we get alarm monitoring for this setup? <span class="small">- Carol, Christchurch.</span> </h4>
                        <div class="speechbubble">
                            <p>Absolutely. Even if the alarm isn't as modern as expected, our installer partners can install control panels with network capability. So you can link to our monitoring service securely over the fibre connection.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Do you install alarms and monitoring for new homes in modern subdivisions such as The Lakes Tauranga?- Bronwyn, Auckland.</h4>
                        <div class="speechbubble">
                            <p>Yes. Security system installations in new housing projects (also known as greenfield projects) are just one scenario we have vast experience dealing with. </p>
                            <p>We at Code9 have a trusted network of installation providers throughout New Zealand who, together with our in-house design team can implement a modern monitoring solution which can go beyond just intruder detection- we can also monitor your smoke alarms providing total piece of mind for you and your family.</p>
                        </div>


                        <h4>Our new home has a hard wired Smoke detector – Can you monitor this for us?</h4>
                        <div class="speechbubble">
                            <p>Smoke detection can be monitored 24/7. Regardless of whether your alarm system is armed or not. Code9 can provide this for you at no extra cost to your monthly alarm monitoring fee.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>I connect to the internet on a Naked DSL plan and I've been told by my ISP that my phone uses VOIP and my alarm may have issues communicating with a monitoring centre. Is this correct? <span class="small">- Rob, Wellington.</span></h4>
                        <div class="speechbubble">
                            <p>This is a common question as more customers find themselves at the crossroads of technology availability as the UFB (fibre) roll out is in progress and the old analogue (copper) phone lines become obsolete.</p>
                            <p>Older broadband connections-such as your VOIP (Voice Over IP) service <strong>are however still able to be connected and monitored by Code9</strong> using the internet as a communication gateway.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>We're about to fit out our new office space in a brand new building in the Christchurch CBD. We have fibre installed and it's live now. Can we organise our own alarm system? <span class="small">- Sasha, Christchurch.</span></h4>
                        <div class="speechbubble">
                            <p>It's always ideal in multi-tenancy situations to work with both tenants and building owners to collaborate on a monitoring and access plan which is integrated and serves everyone's needs for both protection of assets and access control to both the building and your tenancy.</p>
                            <p>If the building owner is providing protection for common areas only we are more than happy to liaise directly with you (and building management if need be) to install a system that meets your particular needs. With fibre already active the connection process for monitoring is relatively simple once the chosen system is installed and a monitoring plan is designed for you in consultation with our design team.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>We lease a business premises in an industrial park where there are security patrols provided (outside normal business hours.) However we are often away from the facility for days at a time. What is a good way to complement their security from our end? <span class=small>- Rob, Timaru.</span> </h4>
                        <div class="speechbubble">
                            <p>At Code9 we can design a monitoring and alarm response plan specific to your day-to-day operational requirements. This could include a Code9 initiated guard response versus a more staged escalation according to a schedule or customer set alarm (armed) status.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Our building has recently been inspected by a fire safety consultant. Along with a number of recommendations she has noted that our fire panel should be connected to our existing alarm monitoring service (who have never mentioned this). What do you recommend? <span class="small">- David, Dunedin.</span> </h4>
                        <div class="speechbubble">
                            <p>It is recommended that your Fire Panel be connected to your monitored alarm panel, so when it is necessary for the Fire Service to be dispatched then Code9 can manage the event for you – dispatching Guards to let the Fire Service in, advising key holders of the situation and ensuring you are kept updated as to the outcomes.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>I manage a multi-level, multi-tenancy building which often has frequent activations. I believe our system is fairly well setup into "zones" however I'd like to get more accurate information about who and where the activations originate. <span class="small">- Steven, Auckland.</span> </h4>
                        <div class="speechbubble">
                            <p>
                                Complex partitioned alarm systems are great, but we understand the frustration when there is an event and you are not sure where the signal has come from. At Code9 we enter the alarm and response information in a clear and concise way so that if there is an event you are advised not only of the building that has activated, but the area within the building and where the detection device is situated within that area.

                        <h4>We are looking to install CCTV in our small shop. We would want it to be monitored live not just recorded for playback. Is this possible and what brands of camera should we look for? <span class="small">- Karen, Auckland.</span> </h4>

                            <p>Code9's Live Video monitoring service is just that - live monitoring of your premises and importantly your staff's wellbeing. As part of a commercial monitoring solution we are happy to point you in the right direction for both hardware and a suitable installer to complete the physical setup.</p>
                            <p>If you are wanting to do some preliminary research we support- amongst most brands, popular systems such as Dahua, Milestone, Vivotek, Mobotix, Hikvision and IMS300.</p>

                        <h4>Our business operates in the heavy construction industry and we have a yard in which we want to install monitored CCTV for a more proactive response to intruders. The area though is surrounded by quite high traffic and trees. Is CCTV surveillance feasible here? <span class="small">- Mike, Rotorua.</span> </h4>
                        <div class="speechbubble">
                            <p>It certainly is. Our CCTV monitoring product- Live Video Monitoring is a technologically advanced approach to CCTV surveillance. Using a hybrid software and human analysis the system can "paint" active tracking regions within a CCTV capture frame. This means we can isolate only the areas you need monitored, ignoring peripheral noise such as people moving through public areas or tree, bird, aircraft crossing the camera's capture view.</p>

                            <p>Code9 has the perfect solution! Our Lone Worker smartphone application paired with button hardware is a discreet device which prompts the wearer through either a vibration or tone to simply press it to confirm a check-in with our Code9 monitoring centre.</p>
                            <p>Additionally if the wearer is in danger or requires assistance the device can send a panic activation to our team for actioning an immediate response.</p>

                        <div class="speechbubble">
                            <p>Yes. Code9 provides medical alarm monitoring services on an individual or corporate basis using similar technology to our Lone Worker product.
